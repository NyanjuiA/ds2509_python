Python Dictionaries
A Python dictionary is a built in data types that represents a collection of key-value pairs, like in a language
dictionary where each word has a corresponding definition.
Dictionaries are unordered, mutable and can store elements of different types.
Each element in a dictionary is accessed by its key rant that its index.
Dictionaries are created using the {} curly brackets/braces.
Some dictionary operations are given below:
"""

# Student dictionary declaration
student = {"name":"Abigail", "age":25, 'major':"Computer Science"}

# Display the length (number of key-value pairs) in the student dictionary
print(f"The number of key-value pairs in the 'student' dictionary is: {len(student)}")

# Fetch and display a view object(method to get the keys of values from a dictionary)
# of the keys in the 'student' dictionary
print(f'The keys from the "student" dictionary are:\n{student.keys()}')

# Fetch and display a view object of the values in the student dictionary
print(f'The values from the "student" dictionary are:\n{student.values()}')

# Get a value from the student dictionary using its key
print(f"The key 'name' in the 'student' dictionary points to: {student.get('name')}")

# Remove and display the contents of a given key when it exists in a dictionary,
# else return/give back an optional default value
phone_no = student.pop('phone_no','Not specified')
print(f"The value of 'phone_no' in the 'student' dictionary is {phone_no}")

# Remove and display the contents of the last key-value pair in the 'student' dictionary
print(f"The last key-value pair in the 'student' dictionary is {student.popitem()}")

# Update/modify and display the contents of the 'student' dictionary

# Create and display a copy of the student dictionary
